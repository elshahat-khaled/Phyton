Llegamos más tarde de lo que habíamos pensado y Ana & Gonçalo nos esperaron pacientemente y nos facilitaron la llegada, además nos recibieron con un regalo de bienvenida!. Nos dieron todo tipo de indicaciones y consejos más que de sobra para disfrutar de los días que estuvimos allí. La ubicación de la casa es inmejorable!! la única pega fue que el soporte de la ducha estaba roto pero como eran pocos días no quisimos molestar a Ana & Gonçalo y no se lo comentamos. ',\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \",\n",

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \\nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.\",\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\",\n",
